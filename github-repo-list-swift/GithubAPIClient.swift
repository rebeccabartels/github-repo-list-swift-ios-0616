//Here, we return nothing because the computer will get back nothing instantly but the closure within this function will work and return when it's ready. completion is not expecting anything immediately "Array -> ()" expects it when it's ready.

It's used in error handling, API calls, NSURL sessions. The array of dictionaries will not be the same in every API. That's why post man is important.
